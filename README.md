# Article Hub

**Article Hub** is a work-in-progress application, originally based on a front-end project which I have adapted into a platform for publishing scientific articles.
Iâ€™m currently working on modifying the front-end and connecting it with the back-end to support a complete workflow for managing and publishing articles.

## Features (in development)

- Create and edit articles
- Associate authors with articles

Article Hub is a robust platform designed to efficiently manage articles and writers. It offers a suite of features aimed at streamlining the publishing workflow, including:

- **Article Management**: Create, edit, and organize articles seamlessly.
- **Writer Association**: Assign and manage writers for each article to ensure proper attribution and collaboration.
- **Publishing Workflow**: Simplify the process from drafting to publishing, enhancing productivity and content quality.

## Features

- **Create and Edit Articles**: Easily draft new articles or modify existing ones with a user-friendly interface.
